# Burnout (CFS/ME) Resources
This repo is designed to house all of the information I've collected as I've worked on recovering from burnout (Chronic fatigue syndrome, ME). It turns out to be a large topic which can be frustratingly nuanced/unclear in some scientific literature.

This repo is in many ways a GH version of my blogpost [Burnout: My story of chronic fatigue, neurodiversity, tech, and my shadow side](https://woodyhayday.com/blog/burnout/), but where possible I've attempted to keep it purely pragmatic here. 

If you have anything useful to add please do raise a PR or reach out via blogpost above, or on X [@woodyhayday](https://twitter.com/woodyhayday). Be good to yourself, and reach out :)

 **Note:** Any and all information here does not replace nor is it intended to replace input from health professionals. This is simply my laymen collected notes on my experience.

## Modes of healing

I tried a lot of things to heal from Burnout. I don't suggest you try any/all of these without professional advice - mileage may vary - be careful, and compassionate with yourself.

 - Nutrition / Probiotics
 - Therapy
 - Creative Outlets: Making things
 - Exercise
 - Reduce your responsibilities & obligations
 - Feel your feelings
 - Renegotiate with ‘work/career’
 - Autonomy and psychological detachment
 - Awareness of neurodiversity
 - Alone time
 - Alternative therapies: Massage, Myofascial release, Reflexology, Acupuncture
 - Alexander Technique
 - Magnesium baths (epsom salt)
 - Play
 - Sleep
 - Drop stimulants, increase relaxants
 - Meditation
 - Breathwork
 - Audiobooks
 - Shakti mats/pillows
 - Microdosing psychedelics
 - Spoons theory
 - Dark room living
 - Embrace your Shadow side: Psychedelic rock, Dark Souls, etc.
 - Pharmaceuticals (Modern Medicine)
 - Gratitude

## Nutrition

There's a lot to this topic, and I'm mostly unqualified to give input. The reason I've included it as a category here is that I believe, (in the current era), that working on your diet is probably always going to help. Working with a qualified nutritionist was one of the most helpful things I did.

See:
- [Action for ME: Diet and Nutrition](https://www.actionforme.org.uk/get-information/managing-your-symptoms/diet-and-nutrition/)
- [BurnoutNutrition.com](https://burnoutnutrition.com/)
- [The ME Association: Diet and Nutrition (Keto)](https://meassociation.org.uk/medical-matters/items/diet-and-nutrition-ketogenic-diet-mecfs/)
- [The ME Association: Diet and Nutrition (Restrictive diets)](https://meassociation.org.uk/medical-matters/items/diet-and-nutrition-restrictive-diets-mecfs/)

 
## Therapy

If you're an engineer type, I'd highly recommend [Transactional Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transactional_analysis), for a models-based therapy mode.

Useful Therapy (TA) terms to look up:

- Kahler's Drivers (Mine were/are [Be Perfect](https://changingminds.org/explanations/motivation/kahler_drivers/be_perfect.htm) and [Please Others](https://changingminds.org/explanations/motivation/kahler_drivers/please_others.htm))
- The Drama Triangle:

## Go easy, friend

I hope this pile of resources has helped, and that you're approaching your challenge with compassion to yourself. I'm on X [@woodyhayday](https://twitter.com/woodyhayday) if you want to reach out. For now I leave this resource stack with a quote which stuck with me as I read about, and went through Burnout:

----

That is wintering. It is the active acceptance of sadness. It is the practice of allowing ourselves to feel it as a need. It is the courage to stare down the worst parts of our experience and to commit to healing them the best we can. Wintering is a moment of intuition, our true needs felt keenly as a knife.
